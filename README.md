# Subtraction-Calculator
I create this git to learn about how big system work. Git Docker HTML Flask and so on. I'll update soon
As you may know that I have a good academic foundation on AI. But with all that experience, I can just work on academic field like doing Master thesis. However, I want to learn more about MLops to automatically deploy a model. There are so much things to learn. And this repo is the first step.

I learn most things on this website [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/)

What have i learn from this repo? 

* Docker the subtract file (build and run docker)

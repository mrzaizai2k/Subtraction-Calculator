# Subtraction-Calculator
I created this repo in order to study how large systems operate. Git Flask HTML Docker, etc. I'll provide an update soon.

As you might be aware, I have a strong academic background in artificial intelligence. With all that expertise, though, I can now focus only on academic tasks, such as writing a master's thesis. To deploy a model automatically, I need to understand more about MLops. There is a ton of information huge learn. The first step is this repo.

I learn most things on this website [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/)

What have i learn from this repo? 

* Docker the subtract file (build and run docker)
* Git commands. Yah my git seems fancy, yet I did it manually. Download, upload with the UI
* Html and flask to call API. To serve a model, we should learn more how to call API for everythings, because no customers would run the cmd like us :) 

Despite being a straightforward repository. To learn about how a large system operates, however, takes a lot of time. The purpose of the aforementioned actions and how to make them function together. I'll update more as I get better on MLOps. Thanks
